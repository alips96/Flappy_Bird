Online Multiplayer Flappy Bird

This game is the online real-time multiplayer version of the iconic flappy bird game. In this game, two players are joined into a room and compete with each other and the player that hit the pipes first loses.

For networking purposes, photon engine is being used. Clients join a room with their name and as soon as the room participants reach two, the match begins and each client has a photon view which enables the other player to observe it across the network.
